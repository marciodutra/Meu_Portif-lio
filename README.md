## Techdegree Project Description
  For your first project, youâ€™ll practice web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. You'll modify the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. This is a great way for you to practice HTML and CSS skills. It also gives you a web page you can use as a personal online calling card to advertise your experience, skills, and goals, and to provide links to your social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub.

  You'll also practice using GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers to share code and work collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is also a great way to share your work with potential employers.

  **NOTE:** _The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript._

  _In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails._
